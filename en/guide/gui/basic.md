# Public Server Networking

The GUI defaults to using official shared nodes for networking, which is convenient for friends without public IPs. In most cases, P2P tunneling can be successful. If P2P tunneling fails, the bandwidth between nodes may be relatively low.

The configuration method is shown in the figure.

After the configuration is complete, click the Run Network button. The interface after the network runs successfully is shown in the figure.

## Running Modes

Starting from version v2.5.0, the GUI supports multiple running modes (Normal, Service, Remote). If you want the network to remain connected after exiting the GUI, or to manage remote servers, please refer to [GUI Running Modes](/en/guide/gui/modes).
