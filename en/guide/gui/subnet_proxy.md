# Subnet Proxy

By setting up a subnet proxy, you can connect the local area network and the virtual local area network.

Assuming the devices at home are in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, and you want to access any device at home from the company, you can start an EasyTier node at home and add a subnet proxy for 192.168.1.0/24. No additional configuration is needed on the company's devices; simply connect to the home node successfully, and you can access any device at home.

Note: After entering the subnet, you need to click on the list item to confirm. After successful confirmation, the subnet will be displayed in card format.

Subnet proxy can perform subnet mapping.
