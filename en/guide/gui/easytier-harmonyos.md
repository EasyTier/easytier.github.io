## Usage Tutorial

- 1. New Button

If you have already configured it on another device, you only need to copy the configuration from the other device and click the paste button here.

If not, you need to give the configuration file you want to add a name for identification.

- 2. Configuration Page

Most configurations are aligned with the original configuration items, except for the credentials. Credentials are merged from the network name and network password to facilitate reuse across multiple configurations.

- 3. Share Button and Air Capture

The left side of p2 is Air Capture, and the right side is the window pulled up after clicking [System Share (Touch-to-Share available)]. You can share it with your other devices. Once listed, other devices will automatically install EasyTier and import the configuration you shared.

#### Whether it is a Peer, a credential, or other configuration items, you need to click them to light them up to indicate they are enabled; otherwise, you have only added the configuration item.
