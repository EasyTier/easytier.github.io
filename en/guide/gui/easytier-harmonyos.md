## Usage Guide

1. New configuration button

If you’ve already configured EasyTier on another device, simply copy that device’s configuration and tap the Paste button here.

If not, give this configuration a recognizable name first.

1. Edit page

Most options align with the original CLI options. Only the credential differs: it is composed of the network name and network password for easier reuse across configs.

1. Share button and Nearby Share

On the left is Nearby Share; on the right is the system Share sheet (supports “tap to share”). You can share to your other devices. After listing in AppGallery, other devices will auto-install EasyTier and import the shared configuration.

- 6. Tips

#### Whether it’s a Peer, a Credential, or any other option, you must tap it to highlight/enable it. Otherwise it is only added, not activated.
