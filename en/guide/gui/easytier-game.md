## Introduction

EasyTier Game Launcher is developed with `nuxt3`, `typescript`, `rust`, and `tauri`. It has a simple interface and comes with the latest EasyTier core. When playing multiplayer games, it provides the most comfortable experience both psychologically and practically. It also supports custom configuration file startup to meet various needs.

## Download

GitHub Releases: [https://github.com/EasyTier/EasytierGame/releases](https://github.com/EasyTier/EasytierGame/releases)

- Only green zip packages are available. Personally, I don't like installers that write to the registry. Just extract and use, keeping the directory clean and tidy.
